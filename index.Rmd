#### The Economic Valuation of Tampa Bay

Tampa Bay is a 400-square-mile estuary situated along the west coast of Florida in the second-most populous region in the state. Tampa Bay is an estuary of national significance and is of vital importance to the surrounding region's economy. The natural resources of Tampa Bay support essential industries such as tourism, mineral extraction, marine transportation, and other commercial and recreational activities. Additionally, the Tampa Bay watershed is comprised of rich and diverse habitats that provide ecosystem services and community benefits that enhance the quality of life.

The purpose of the Economic Valuation of Tampa Bay is to provide an economic valuation of the natural resources in Tampa Bay and its watershed. The results demonstrate the Tampa Bay estuary’s value in providing substantial economic, social, and environmental benefits to the region’s industries, residents, and visitors. Moreover, the methodologies established herein provide a replicable process for performing a valuation of Tampa Bay.

#### Using the dashboard

Explore the methods and results of the study through the different pages of this dashboard. Tampa Bay’s value is illustrated in three different ways:

1) Economic Impacts of Industry Sectors. This page summarizes the annual economic impacts, including output, jobs, and wages, generated by bay-dependent industries on the economy.
1) Property Value Amenity Impacts. This page examines the effects of bay proximity on property value premiums for single-family homes within a quarter mile of the water. 
1) Ecosystem Services. This page highlights the value of ecosystem services (carbon sequestration, denitrification, and flood protection) provided by habitats across Tampa Bay, such as mangrove forests, saltwater marshes, and freshwater wetlands. 

Methodological summaries for each of these three analyses can be found in the Methods pages. For more detailed information regarding data sources, calculations, modelling, and results, consult the full 2023 Economic Valuation of Tampa Bay report, which can be downloaded using the link on the right side of this page.

### Using this page

This page shows the overall report card for the bay as management action categories:


In the above example, the attainment outcome for Old Tampa Bay in 1980 was <span style="color:#CC3231">On Alert</span>.  Additional information on chlorophyll and light attenuation outcomes that drive the overall attainment outcome are also provided.  Old Tampa Bay received an outcome of "3" for both chlorophyll and light attenuation results in 1980.  Possible integer values range from 0 to 3, with three indicating water quality conditions less suitable for seagrass growth.  The integer values describe both a magnitude and duration of exceedance for chlorophyll or light attenuation targets: 

A similar matrix is provided for light attenuation. It is important to note that in both the chlorophyll and light attenuation matrices, the reference values represent a large exceedance value defined as twice the standard error of the historic average for years when water quality conditions were favorable for seagrass growth. 

Finally, an interactive map is provided on the right to demonstrate which stations were above or below water quality targets or thresholds defined for each bay segment.  The points are color-coded to show if the target or threshold was met and sized by the relative concentration or attenuation values observed in the selected year.  Hovering the mouse pointer over each station will show the following:

### Using this page

This page shows the overall report card for the bay as management action categories:


In the above example, the attainment outcome for Old Tampa Bay in 1980 was <span style="color:#CC3231">On Alert</span>.  Additional information on chlorophyll and light attenuation outcomes that drive the overall attainment outcome are also provided.  Old Tampa Bay received an outcome of "3" for both chlorophyll and light attenuation results in 1980.  Possible integer values range from 0 to 3, with three indicating water quality conditions less suitable for seagrass growth.  The integer values describe both a magnitude and duration of exceedance for chlorophyll or light attenuation targets: 

A similar matrix is provided for light attenuation. It is important to note that in both the chlorophyll and light attenuation matrices, the reference values represent a large exceedance value defined as twice the standard error of the historic average for years when water quality conditions were favorable for seagrass growth. 

Finally, an interactive map is provided on the right to demonstrate which stations were above or below water quality targets or thresholds defined for each bay segment.  The points are color-coded to show if the target or threshold was met and sized by the relative concentration or attenuation values observed in the selected year.  Hovering the mouse pointer over each station will show the following:
